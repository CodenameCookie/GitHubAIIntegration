## GitHub AI Integration

I was trying to upload files individually over and over for every interation of my Python code in my development cycle.
Became akward to have to keep uploading the files to the OpenAI ChatGPt intepretor interface over and over.
So I developed this repo so that the AI can integrate wiith GitHub via the API and fetch entire codebases in one call even as we push fixes to the code.
